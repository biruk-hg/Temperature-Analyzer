The TemperatureAnalyzer project is a Java-based tool designed for analyzing and visualizing weekly temperature data for three cities: Hartford, Seattle, and Boston. Users can input daily temperatures for each city, and the program calculates and displays the average temperatures as well as identifies the city with the highest temperature for each day. To use the program, simply run the Java file and follow the prompts to input temperature data. Additionally, users can query the program for the average temperature of a specific city. For further details on usage and understanding the code, refer to the inline comments within the Java file.
